Hi! I’m Hüsne, a postdoc at the University of Bar Ilan, in Department of Physics, Ramat Gan, Israel. I’m an Astrophysicist and data analyst.

My work and research
======
My expertise covers the physics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and GRBs, and the analysis of the high energy data acquired by \textit{Swift} (XRT and BAT), and \textit{Fermi} (GBM and LAT). Therefore, I have a profound knowledge of the analysis pipelines and techniques required to perform the data analysis of high energy sources. Specifically I can efficiently use, among others, the Fermi Science Tools, HeaSoft package, and 3ML. I am also proficient at using IRAF routines to analyze optical photometric and spectroscopic data optained by different optical telescopes e.g. Tarot and Zadko robotic telescopes, TNG, WFI. Finally, my data analysis skills are completed by advanced knowledge of the python (2.7 and 3.6) and c programming languages, and how to combine them with cython.

This knowledge was acquired during my ten years of experience in research, from my M.Sc. project on spectral interpretation of the high energy component of LAT blazars, to my recent postdoc in which I am combining data from the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands to constrain the emission mechanisms at work in GRB prompt phase and GRB afterglows. Moreover, I was a member of the LIGO collaboration during my PhD. It gave me the opportunity to learn more about gravitational waves, their connection to short GRBs and how multi-messenger data can be used to constrain GRB emission.


My background and history
======
I received my Ph.D. degree in Relativistic Astrophysic from the Nice University, France in 2014. I was a Ph.D. student in the IRAP program in Europe and Asia between 2011-2014. I hold a M.Sc. degree in Astrophysics from the Çukurova University, Turkey in 2010. I also studied as an Erasmus student in Padova University, Italy in 2009. My B.Sc. degree is in Physics from the Çukurova University, Turkey in 2006. Between 2015-2018 at the KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), Sweden, I was first a postdoctoral scholar. Then between 2018-2020, I was a postdoc at the MPE (Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics), Germany. I am currently a postdoc at the Bar Ilan University, Israel. My work evolves around the Relativistic Astrophysics with the specific focus on the data analysis of the gamma-rays and X-rays emissions from short-long GRBs and AGNs.
