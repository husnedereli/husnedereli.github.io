The origin of the plateau phase observed in the early X-ray light curve of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been debated since its discovery in 2005. Here we show that the plateau phase can be explained within the classical fireball model by considering an expanding outflow that is ejected with a Lorentz factor lower than typically assumed. Therefore, the gap of the inferred Lorentz factors in active galactic nuclei and in GRBs no longer exist.
