We introduced a novel approach to fitting multiple afterglow models to GRB X-ray light curves. This approach enabled the accurate determination of flares and their properties. Considering bursts with and without a plateau separately, I showed in a statistical analysis that the flare temporal properties are the same. This finding supports the idea presented in Dereli-Bégué et al. (2022) that plateaus are produced by a slower relativistic jet evolving in a wind-like environment.
